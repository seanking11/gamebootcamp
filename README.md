# Game Dev Bootcamp

A comprehensive game development course built for software developers. 38 genre modules covering every major game genre — from Pong to Sandbox. Build MVP versions of classic games, learn the mechanics that make them tick, and understand the history that shaped them.

## What's Inside

- **38 genre modules** — each with historical context, mechanics breakdown with pseudocode, MVP spec, and discussion questions
- **12 learning paths** — curated sequences through the modules based on your interest (Combat, Strategy, Narrative, 3D, etc.)
- **Genre encyclopedia** — quick reference for 40+ game genres covering what defines them and their landmark games
- **Analogies by background** — every module maps game concepts to patterns from backend, frontend, and data/ML engineering

## Quick Start

1. Read the **[Syllabus](SYLLABUS.md)** for the full module index
2. Pick a **[Learning Path](LEARNING_PATHS.md)** or start with the **[Foundation Path](#foundation-path)**
3. Open the first module and start building

## Foundation Path

The recommended starting point. Four genres that build on each other:

| Module | Genre | What You'll Learn |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| [01](modules/01-pong/README.md) | Pong | Game loop, input, collision, state |
| [02](modules/02-platformer/README.md) | 2D Platformer | Gravity, tilemaps, game feel |
| [03](modules/03-top-down-shooter/README.md) | Top-Down Shooter | Entity management, AI, pooling |
| [04](modules/04-endless-runner/README.md) | Endless Runner | Procedural generation, difficulty curves |

Then pick from 34 more modules across every genre — or build your own game in the [Capstone](modules/13-capstone/README.md).

## All Learning Paths

| Path | Focus | Modules |
|------|-------|---------|
| [Foundation](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-1-foundation-start-here) | Core game dev | 5 |
| [Full 2D Journey](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-2-the-full-2d-journey) | Comprehensive 2D | 11 |
| [Into 3D](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-3-into-the-third-dimension) | FPS, 3D platformer, TPS | 7-8 |
| [Combat Deep Dive](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-4-combat-deep-dive) | Fighting, shooting, action | 7 |
| [Strategy & Systems](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-5-strategy--systems) | Tactics, economy, planning | 6-7 |
| [Narrative & Story](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-6-narrative--story) | Interactive fiction, dialog | 6 |
| [Puzzle & Logic](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-7-puzzle--logic) | Spatial reasoning, physics | 6 |
| [Roguelike & Procedural](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-8-roguelike--procedural) | Generation, randomness | 7 |
| [Simulation & Management](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-9-simulation--management) | Economies, ecosystems | 6-7 |
| [Casual & Mobile](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-10-casual--mobile) | Accessible, replayable | 6 |
| [Party & Social](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-11-party--social) | Multiplayer, social games | 5 |
| [RPG Spectrum](LEARNING_PATHS.md#path-12-rpg-spectrum) | Stats, loot, progression | 7 |

## Format

Each module follows the same structure:

- **Week 1:** History and design theory — where the genre came from, what makes it great
- **Week 2:** Build the MVP — core concepts with pseudocode, stretch goals, and a spec
- **Analogies by Background:** Game concepts mapped to backend, frontend, and data/ML patterns
- **Discussion Questions:** For group sessions or self-reflection

Time commitment: **2-4 hours per module** over 2 weeks.

## Who This Is For

Software developers who want to understand game development. No prior game dev experience needed — just programming fundamentals. The course is engine-agnostic (Unity, Godot, Phaser, raw Canvas, or anything else).
