# Module 13: Capstone

**Your final 2 weeks | Combine everything into something original**

> "The best way to prove you understand the mechanics is to remix them."

---

## The Brief

Build a playable game in a genre of your choice. It can be:

1. **A genre we covered** — but with a twist (e.g., a Pong game with gravity, a platformer with shooting mechanics, an endless runner with enemy waves)
2. **A genre we didn't cover** — using the skills you've built (see the [Genre Encyclopedia](../../GENRES.md) for ideas)
3. **A mashup** — combine mechanics from multiple modules into something new

The goal is not polish. The goal is to demonstrate that you can identify the core mechanics of a genre and implement them.

## Constraints

- **Time:** Same as every module — 2-4 hours total over 2 weeks
- **Scope:** One core mechanic, playable from start to game-over. Resist the urge to scope up.
- **Solo or pair:** You can work alone or with one partner

## Suggested Genres (If You Need Ideas)

Check the [Genre Encyclopedia](../../GENRES.md) for the full list. Here are some that make great capstone projects because they combine concepts from multiple modules:

| Genre | Core Mechanic | Concepts It Combines |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Metroidvania** | Ability-gated exploration | Platformer + Roguelike (interconnected map, item systems) |
| **Bullet Hell** | Survive dense patterns | Shooter + Endless Runner (patterns, difficulty curves) |
| **Rhythm Game** | Input synced to music | New concept (audio sync) + state machines + scoring |
| **Sokoban / Puzzle** | Push blocks to solve spatial puzzles | Puzzle (grid logic) + turn-based (Roguelike) |
| **Survival Crafting** | Gather, craft, survive | Roguelike (inventory) + Tower Defense (building) |
| **Auto-Battler** | Draft and position, watch combat | Tower Defense (placement) + Deckbuilder (drafting) |
| **Visual Novel** | Branching narrative choices | New concept (dialog trees, story graphs) |
| **Vampire Survivors-like** | Inverted bullet hell + roguelite upgrades | Shooter + Roguelike + Deckbuilder (build choices) |
| **3D Exploration** | Navigate a 3D space to find/collect items | FPS (3D movement/camera) + Roguelike (items) |
| **Kart Racer** | Racing with items and chaos | Racing + power-ups (Shooter) + 3D (FPS/3D Platformer) |

## Deliverables

### 1. Pitch (End of Week 1)

A 2-3 sentence description of what you're building:
- What genre?
- What's the core mechanic?
- What concepts from the course does it use?

### 2. Playable MVP (End of Week 2)

A game that:
- Has a clear core mechanic
- Has a start state and an end state (game over, win, or endless with scoring)
- Is playable by someone who didn't build it (basic UI/instructions)

### 3. Post-Mortem Write-Up

A short reflection (half a page or less):
- What genre did you pick and why?
- What was the hardest technical challenge?
- What did you learn about game design that surprised you?
- If you had 2 more weeks, what would you add?
- What concept from the course clicked the most for you?

## Presentation (Optional)

If the group is doing this together, spend 30 minutes at the end where each person demos their game for 2-3 minutes. Keep it casual — show the game running, talk about one thing you're proud of and one thing that was hard.

## What "Done" Looks Like

You've successfully completed the bootcamp if you can:

- [ ] Explain the game loop and why delta time matters
- [ ] Implement basic collision detection and response
- [ ] Model game entities as data that systems operate on
- [ ] Build a player character with physics and state management
- [ ] Manage many entities with object pooling and spawn systems
- [ ] Generate content procedurally with solvability constraints
- [ ] Tune difficulty with parameterized curves
- [ ] Design turn-based systems with phase ordering
- [ ] Implement pathfinding and spatial reasoning
- [ ] Build data-driven systems (card effects, wave tables, upgrade trees)
- [ ] Navigate 3D space with first-person or third-person cameras
- [ ] Identify the core mechanic of any game genre you encounter

Congratulations. You're a game developer.
